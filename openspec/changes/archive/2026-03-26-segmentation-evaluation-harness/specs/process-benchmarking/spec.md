## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Process runs SHALL persist structured benchmark records
Each successful `npm run process` invocation SHALL persist a structured benchmark record under `generated/benchmarks/` for that run. The record SHALL include a unique run identifier, start and completion timestamps, total elapsed runtime, major pipeline phase durations, workload counts, and effective runtime configuration needed to compare runs. When segmentation-quality evaluation is active, the benchmark record SHALL also preserve the quality metrics collected for that evaluation run.

#### Scenario: Benchmark record captures segmentation-quality context
- **WHEN** a benchmark record is written for a process or evaluation run that collects segmentation-quality metrics
- **THEN** the record SHALL include transcript-targeting, transcript-probing, transcript-excerpt, speech-fallback, and semantic-validation counters when available
- **THEN** the record SHALL preserve any fixture-set identifier used for that run
